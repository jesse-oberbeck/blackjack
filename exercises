1. Let the program be used as the following:

./blackjack [ -s ] [ -n <number of decks> ] <number of cards in hand>

You will need to use `optind` to get <number of cards in hand>.  Read the getopt manpage.


2. Create a function:

	void hand_add(card struct **hand, card struct *c);

Which will add a card to the hand.


3. Create a function:

	int dealer(struct deck *d);

Which will simulate a dealer.  They start with two cards, and then draw until they have 17 or more points, at which poin they stop.  The function should return the total score of the dealer.
